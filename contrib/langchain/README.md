## Important Notice

**This package has been deprecated and is no longer maintained.**

The `langchain-arcade` package is no longer needed. Arcade now provides better ways to integrate with your AI applications.

## What Should I Use Instead?

Please visit **[docs.arcade.dev](https://docs.arcade.dev)** for the latest documentation on how to integrate Arcade tools into your applications.

Arcade now supports:
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** - The recommended way to use Arcade tools with AI agents
- **Direct API integration** - Use the [Arcade Python SDK](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-py) or [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-js)

## Migration Guide

If you were previously using `langchain-arcade`, we recommend:

1. Visit [docs.arcade.dev](https://docs.arcade.dev) to learn about the new integration options
2. Consider using Arcade's MCP server for seamless tool integration
3. Check out the [Arcade Python SDK](https://github.com/ArcadeAI/arcade-py) for direct API access
